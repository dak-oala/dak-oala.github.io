A timeline representing the progress made to my first [RPG game](https://google.com). These logs serve to help me understand how I moved during development, such as what I did first, how long something took, etc.

5/5/19 - Set up display initiating methods, asset management/loader methods, camera display method, and other essential game elements.

5/4/19 - Successfully set up IntelliJ IDEA IDE, implemented Gradle, installed LibGDX, and ran demo project by LibGDX. Programming language used is Java and the development is following this book: [Mastering LibGDX Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-libgdx-game-development) by Patrick Hoey.
