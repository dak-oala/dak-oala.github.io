## What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity (running time) is a way of measuring how long an algorithm takes to run, and does so accurately despite the system used to test the code (ie, slow vs fast computer). It does not measure in a unit of time, such as seconds, but rather as a function of the input and describes the worse-case scenario.

Also known as the upper bound of the growth rate of a function
