Roblox is a platform that joins millions of users together through user-generated content. Anyone can sign up for an account and start playing the games posted. But you can also create your own games, which if successful enough can earn you money.

The problem is, Roblox is commonly overlooked as a children's game. You couldn't seriously tell someone you create roblox games, unless you want to feel the shame that they quietly put on you. And it makes sense too. The front page of roblox is filled with terrible replicas that are meant to be quick cash-grabs. This means that they are made not with the intention of creating a strong player base, but rather to intrigue you enough to buy an in-game product before they inevitably shut down due to loss of interest.

So, what makes Roblox so interesting then? One reason is the fact that these cash-grabs actually produce large profits. But the other reason is that Roblox is actually home to some very intricate creations that the developers put real effort into maintaining. And you'd be surprised with what's actually possible.

But first, let's go over some stats. Just how much can you make developing Roblox games? The $4B dollar company is set to pay out over $250M to it's developers in 2020, with it's most popular game, Adopt Me, exceeding over $50M in yearly revenue. YES, these are $USD amounts. These payouts are up more than 800% since 2017, and are only expected to grow further. Adopt Me currently has a dev team of over 30 people, who each have professional salaries that range from $60-100k+/year. Roblox is supplying real people will real opportunities.

The main reason that the majority of front page Roblox games are brainless cash-grabs is because children actually enjoy these. Roblox, after all, was made for children. And if these games work, people will continue to produce them. These games are simulator games, where the user repeats an action for a reward, which in turn allows them to repeat the same action at a quicker rate. These are constantly being reinvented (ex. cookie simulator, box simulator, ice simulator, whatever you can think of). For older Roblox players, typically middle-highschool users, there are less popular games which prove to take a lot of effort and show great quality. And these make money too, of course, but likely not as much.
