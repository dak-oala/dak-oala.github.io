## Why Roblox?

Roblox is a platform that joins millions of users together through user-generated content. Anyone can sign up for an account and start playing the games posted. But you can also create your own games, which if successful enough can earn you money.

The problem is, Roblox is commonly overlooked as a children's game. You couldn't seriously tell someone you create roblox games, unless you want to feel the shame that they quietly put on you. And it makes sense too. The front page of Roblox is filled with terrible replicas that are meant to be quick cash-grabs. This means that they are made not with the intention of creating a strong player base, but rather to intrigue you enough to buy an in-game product before they inevitably shut down due to loss of interest.

So, what makes Roblox so interesting then? One reason is the fact that these cash-grabs actually produce large profits. But the other reason is that Roblox is actually home to some very intricate creations that the developers put real effort into maintaining.

The main reason that the majority of front page Roblox games are brainless cash-grabs is because children actually enjoy these. Roblox, after all, was made for children. And if these games work, people will continue to produce them. These games are simulator games, where the user repeats an action for a reward, which in turn allows them to repeat the same action at a quicker rate. These are constantly being reinvented (ex. cookie simulator, box simulator, ice simulator, whatever you can think of). For older Roblox players, typically middle-highschool users, there are less popular games which prove to take a lot of effort and show great quality. And these make money too, of course, but likely not as much.

## How much money can a developer earn?

Let's go over some stats. Just how much can you make developing Roblox games? The $4B dollar company is set to pay out over $250M to it's developers in 2020, with it's most popular game, Adopt Me, exceeding over $50M in yearly revenue. YES, these are $USD amounts. These payouts are up more than 800% since 2017, and are only expected to grow further. Adopt Me currently has a dev team of over 30 people, who each have professional salaries that range from $60-100k+/year. Roblox is supplying real people will real opportunities. Not to mention the two college students who were able to pay for college through the money earned via developing on Roblox.

## Roblox's Rapid Growth

Roblox may be going even further, though. Adopt Me is currently being seen as a huge deal on Roblox. The game exceeded a concurrent player count (1.6M) that surpassed even some of the most popular video games of all time. The game has proven itself to be an industry competitor, and has held this position for a long time. This has caused developers to question how many more of these can come out? Some even predict that leading game companies such as Ubisoft or Activision will attempt to step into Roblox. Roblox continues to upgrade its engine and add compatibility for extreme creations, and it's limits are not low. This worried the many indie devs that are able to make a living off Roblox. Many of these developers don't actually need to be front-page to earn decent revenue. But if companies start to see interest in Roblox, it could disturb the cash flow of independent creators. This is mostly speculation however. 

To add on to it's growth: Originally Lua 5.1 was used to create games on Roblox Studio, the engine used by developers. However, Roblox has done so much with the language to grow the engine that they started developing what they called Luau. A backwards-compatible typed language that is specific to Roblox. The company invest a lot into making sure that games are efficient and powerful.

I often see many snapshots of creations made by developers that almost seem unreal. Some of these creations look almost too good to be on Roblox, and rather something developed on an engine such as Unreal. Here are a few examples posted by devs following a huge lighting update:

Pretty cool.

## Commisions

Creating a game takes a lot of effort. This applies to Roblox as well. You need scripters, builders, modeling, animations, GFX, etc. While it's completely possible to learn these skills and make a game alone, you don't even have to go down the route of creating a game. Game designers are always contracting others to work for them. For example, you may be a very good programmer, but terrible at using Blender. You could hire someone to model a weapon or tool so you only have to worry about the programming aspect. And the people being contracted can make good money off it too.

## My Goals

I've been learning to script on Roblox for almost a month now, and I've learned so much. The community of developers is great and there is always someone there to help answer your questions. My goal is simple: to make money developing Roblox games, and prove it can be worthwhile to learn. Easy to say, but hard to do. I'd like to cash out the minimum amount you can on Roblox, which is $350. This requires you to earn R$100,000 (Robux, the currency of Roblox). You earn Robux by selling ingame items. But if you're able to make $350, no reason you can't use these funds to make even more. I've been scripting consistently, and I plan to continue to do so.
