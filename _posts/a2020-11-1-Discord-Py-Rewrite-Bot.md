## What is discord?

https://discord.com/

Discord is a messaging app that makes it easy to bring people with similar interest together.
Poeple come together in "servers" where you can easily talk to others and share information.

## What is a discord bot?

A discord bot is an artifical user within a server that can be used to automate tasks or simply make them easier.
There are bots for moderating users, playing music and games, or simply giving out information.
These bots are NOT malicious and are programmed by users for specific tasks.

## Why discord?

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, it's nearly impossible to stay in close touch with friends and enjoy school the way we used to.
School would become an endless cycle of switching between virtual calls without the chance to catch up with friends and have social interactions.
We decided to create a discord server so it would be easy to stay in touch.
We divided the server into sections that aligned with our classes, and we could talk to eachother through voice call between classes and afterschool.
We also had sections for gaming, hobbies, and simply talking whenever. It made it very easy to talk to eachother everyday.
After months, we still do everyday, and to be honest, I don't know how I'd be surviving school without it.

## Kody

I gave my Discord bot the name Kody. Originally, Kody was not meant to do much.
Because online classes does not offer a bell system that reminds you when the next period starts, the only way to be on time is to constantly watch the clock or to set up multiple alarms on your phone.
Both are terrible solutions.
Discord bots have the ability to "ping a user", which is basically just sending a notification to your computer. Users ping eachother when they want to get their attention.

Kody's only task, originally, was to ping everyone that goes to my highschool whenever the period starts (The server had many friends, and not everyone went to my HS).

Kody could easily tell you when the next period was starting, and remind you to get ready when it was about to start.
