## What is Discord?

https://discord.com/

Discord is a messaging app that makes it easy to bring people with similar interest together.

People come together in "servers" where you can easily talk to others and share information. Servers are divided into sections (think "multiple group chats" in a single collection).

## What is a Discord Bot?

A discord bot is an artifical user within a server that can be used to automate tasks or simply make them easier.

There are bots for moderating users, playing music and games, or simply giving out information.

These bots are NOT malicious and are programmed by users for specific tasks.

## The Bot

I gave my Discord bot the name Kody.

Because online classes do not offer a bell system that remind you when the next class starts, the only way to be on time is to constantly watch the clock or to set up multiple alarms on your phone.

Both are terrible solutions.

Discord bots have the ability to "ping a user", which is basically just sending a notification to your computer. Users ping eachother when they want to get their attention.

Kody's app status constantly updates to inform you how many minutes are left until the next class. When the class is about to start, you get pinged.
