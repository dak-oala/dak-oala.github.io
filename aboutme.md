> “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.” - The Elephant Rope

Inspirational.

My goal with this webpage is to track developments made while learning. I have many goals, and this portfolio was made to document and display that.

[Here](https://dak-oala.github.io/egshowcase/) is a sample post I would create for a project.

Here are some of my goals:

* Get into *ML*
* Script a *Roblox* game
* Learn *Python*
* Create a 2D *Java* game
