> “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.” - The Elephant Rope

An Elephant has the largest brain of any land mammal, their brain weighing roughly eleven pounds. Limitations are set in at a young age that prevent motivation at later ages.

As we grow, however, so do our capabilities. What you couldn't do before may not be as hard now, especially through practice.

Accepting norms *will* trap you.

Learning just about anything related to CS will expand your knowledge in other fields of CS. The same way syntax of one language can be understood so much easier after having known another language.

My goal with this webpage is to track developments made while learning. I have many goals, short and long term- and this portfolio was made to help me in all I do.
