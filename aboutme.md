I'm a highschool student very passionate about Computer Science & Math!
This website is my portfoilio, where I'll showcase my progress made as I learn more about these topics.

Here are a few of my current goals:

* Improve Roblox Scripting & Develop a game
* Use Python to create some ML application
* Learn EE, i.e. Arduino programming

* Get into AP Calc BC this year...
