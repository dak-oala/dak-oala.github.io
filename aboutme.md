> “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.” - The Elephant Rope

An Elephant has the largest brain of any land mammal. Their brain weigh roughly 11 pounds. Limitations are set in at a young age that prevent motivation at later ages.

As we grow up, so do our capabilities. What you couldn't do before may not be as hard, especially through practice.

Accepting norms *will* trap you.
