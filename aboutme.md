I'm a highschool student very passionate about Computer Science & Math!
This website is my portfoilio, where I'll showcase my progress made as I learn more about these topics.

Here are a few of my current goals:

* Improve Roblox Scripting & Develop a game
* Build an Instagram bot to grow a theme page
* Learn EE, i.e. Arduino programming
