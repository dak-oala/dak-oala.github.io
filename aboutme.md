subtitle: And about this portfolio
---

This portfolio serves to showcase all the projects I work on as I explore and learn about the fields of computer science.
I take great pride in the fact that I'm self-taught, and this portfolio further proves the accomplishments I've made.

Of course, self-taught doesn't mean I've done it alone. Throughout the posts and project descriptions I include lots of resources and links that I've personally grown and learn from, which are summarized [here](https://dakota-byte.github.io/othersources/)

Many posts will be "notes" that I take, of which I try to rewrite what I've learned into my own words. Both to prove that I understand the concept, and to be able to refer to it later. And to keep track of what I'm doing, of course. The sources I get the information from are likely to be much more useful, however. These will be tagged as "Notes" [under tags](https://dakota-byte.github.io/tags/)

Theres a tab dedicated to bigger and more sophistacted projects, aka not just notes.
